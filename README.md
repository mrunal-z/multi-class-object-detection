This project was for the course CS-271: Topics in Machine Learning.

# Multi-class Object Detection in Images

The objective of this project was to detect 5 different classes - car, truck, pedestrian, traffic light and bicyclist - in a given image. The task of object detection was be done using 2 different machine learning algorithms; SVM and YOLO algorithm.

## Dataset
The dataset that was used for this project was the [Self-Driving Cars dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alincijov/self-driving-cars) on Kaggle. This dataset contains 22,241 images, divided into train and test splits, where the images contain multiple objects from the given 5 classes.
